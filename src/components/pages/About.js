I recently graduated from Troy High School, and will be studying Computer Engineering next year at UCI. In my free time I like coding, 3D printing, and of course gaming (im immortal peak 16 RR, going to be hardstuck ascendant in Valorant). I’ve also started working out and cooking steaks &#128523;. Hopefully you'll find this website interesting!
